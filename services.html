                                                          This industry has particularly unique requirements that are not common in other industries. There are four main aspects to businesses in this industry: Buying goods and services, sourcing, contract management, and operation management.
                                                          1) Buying Goods and Services,  
Procurement plays an important part in the hospitality industry. This is about acquiring goods and services for hotels, restaurants, and similar businesses. Even industry experts frequently mix up procurement and purchase. The purchase procedure entails ordering products after the procurement department has recruited the suppliers to provide the goods.

2) Operational Management,  
Identifying sources for supplies, negotiation, payment plans, and cycle management are all important aspects of the procurement function. They can separate a top-notch business from one that falls short of expectations.

3) Sourcing, 
Sourcing is the process of finding potential suppliers for the different goods and services required by your company. Once selected, requests for prices and bids must be submitted, manufacturing facilities must be examined, and quality issues must be handled.

4) Contract Management, 
Contract management is the center of procurement, which is essential for building excellent relationships with suppliers and ensuring dependability. Payment conditions are mutually agreed upon here, all in the service of cash flow.

                                                                The purpose of this study is to show the implementation of a feasibility study for the hotel project by using Political, Economic, Social and Technology (PEST) analysis, Porter’s five forces and Resource-Based View (RBV). A case study was conducted in a full-service independent four-star hotel project in Bandung, Indonesia. Direct observation from the researchers in the hotel project and secondary data analysis from related documents are used in the feasibility study report to support the investigation. Finally, the capital budget calculation is being used to recommend the feasibility of the hotel project. As a result, it is apparent that the hotel X investment is feasible to proceed. Some recommendations are given for hotel owners related to the business environment analysis and in creating a feasibility study specially designed for the hotel business. Managerial implication of this study can be useful for companies in making the right decisions in the development or expansion, and to minimise the long-term losses. Limitation of this research is in only analysing one hotel in a four-star classification; further analysis can be applied in a different location, classification, and different types of hotel service.
